lipstick: clean code beauty

lipstick provides a set of Java source manipulations to "purify" code bases of inconsistencies in code style.

At the moment lipstick only provides the interactive removal of constructor comments.
Interactive means, lipstick first collects all comments, counts how often they appear and lets you
manually toggle which comment will be removed.

More manipulations types are planned.
