# lipstick
lipstick code beauty since 2015

lipstick provides a set of Java source manipulations to "purify" code bases of inconsistenties in code style.

At the moment lipstick only provides the interactive removal of constructor comments.
Interactive means, lipstick first collects all comments, counts how often they appear and lets you
manually toggle which comment will be removed.
